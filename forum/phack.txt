It is well known pitfall of using p-value, that false positives are recognized as valid research results, especially if they support original hypothesis. This is especially true, where satisfactory p-value level is the only criterion for results assessment.
A drive to produce results is fueled with increasingly mercantile nature of research. The research sponsor - be it in academia on in corporate, is expecting return from the money invested. The more conclusive, more accurate results, the better. Short delivery time is also an asset.
As noted in the article, with the advent of big data and machine learning, production of *some* results is becoming increasingly cheap and easy, while review and recognition of false positives is as costly as usual.
Circumstantial relationships are especially difficult to debunk, especially when they fit a desired narrative.
In order to improve the bad reputation the science has recently gained, I believe that publication of the results should be delivered in possibly informative manner - with visualisation and "executive summary", possible to comprehend for readers outside of the research field.
Facilitating access to scientific research would not only allow people to be better educated about the nature of the scientific process, but also be informed about the current status of the human knowledge. 
This notion is extremely optimistic, since most potential readers simply will not be interested in following the studies, but at least it would allow greater control overs "science journalism", which is partly to blame for the current state of affairs.
